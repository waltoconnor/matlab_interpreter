# Matlab Interpreter
This is a lexer, parser, and interpreter for a subset of Matlab, written in Python.
This was a group project by Walt O'Connor, Matthew Hall, and Dave Patterson done for a graduate programming language class.

See `./interpreter` for the implementation code, see `./test_code` for working examples, and see `OpSem.pdf` and `matlab_ebnf.pdf` for the semantic and syntactic specifications for matlab.
